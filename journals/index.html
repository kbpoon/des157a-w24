                    </figure>
                    <p>From looking at the image alone, unless you are a fan, you would not be able to tell exactly what I collect. There are signed items but they vary in sizes and color. This is an image of a few of the signed albums I have from a K-Pop band called ATEEZ. There is a signed album for every member of the band except one. From first glance, if unfamiliar with K-Pop you wouldnt be able to tell they are CDs. In the front there is a photocard of one of the band's members (whose signed album I don't currently have in Davis). The idea is to instruct the user to hover over the photo of the band memeber, then he will tell them to hover over the album signatures. </p>
                        
                    <p> When hovering over a signed album or the photocard, I wanted to display the photocards from those albums that I collect and information about the member that signed it. ATEEZ is one of my favorite bands and my signed album collection and photocard collection show how important they are in my life. I've personally skipped midterms to see them in concert and have followed them through multiple stops (I saw them live 6 times in one year!).</p>

                    <p>This is Lupe's photo for her studio. It is a picture of Gamcheon Culture Village in Korea. One of the more visually interesting aspects of the image is the arch made of little houses. The alley is also filled with brightly colored buildings and lively signage. </p>

                        <p>To me it is obvious that it is Korea due to the Hangul signage. Others may not be able to recgonize it. As a place, Gamcheon might not be well known to others so I am curious about the stories the place will tell.</p>

                    <p>One of the most important things to do when closely analyzing a visual is paying careful attention to details and honing that skill on a regular. If open ended questions are asked about the image, they will likely make more observations as there is not right or wrong answer</p>
                    
                    <p>People can then further their understanding of a piece by building off other people's observations. This would including building off of the original intentions of the images.</p>

                    <p>The Curious and Co website uses a lot of detailed images that makes the viewers curious about the rest of the content. The website has CTAs that are reminiscent of tarot card readings and other whimsical or mystic things.</p>

                    <p>Modals can be used to display additional information on a page with content that needs to grab the user's attention. These modals should be clearly titled and give users a way to exit out of it. This can be done with buttons.</p>
                    
                    <p>The size of a modal shouldn't be too large or too big. The background should also be darkened so that users can focus on the pop-up rather than the content it's sitting on top of. Additionally, all modals should be triggered by the user's rather than a spontaneous ad. This will prevent user's from clicking out of it immediately.</p>

                    <p>Essentially, the best way to make well designed forms is to create it in digestable chunks without overloading the user with information. Making it vertical and also starting with basic questions and progressing into more difficult ones will help the users go through the form more smoothly. </p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, it is essential to be clear about what information you want from the user. This can be done by marking required fields or cleaerly stating the desired format for the input. things such as clear typography as well as proper sizing for elements is also extremely important.</p>
                    
                    <p>One of the worst forms I have encountered was an application for an old award in highschool. There were many fields present on one page and sections asking for files without specifying where to put such documents. Unfortunately, I no longer have the link to the application as I am no longer apart of that organization.
