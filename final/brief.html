                    <h2><strong>Project Brief</strong></h2>
                    <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> I will be editing my Every Picture Project because I am the most proud of the outcome and I feel passionate about the subject matter to iterate further.</p>
                    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong>My major focus of the porject will be to improve on the functionality of my project. As of now, it is every simple and does not contain much content. I want to implement click interations for the polaroids and add content to them using overlays. Thesse overlays would contain infomation on each of the members to introduce my favorite group. I would also like to add an audio feature as they are musical artists. These would also activate on the card clicks. To improve usability, I will aim to make ti responsive. As for design and usability together, one of the biggest critiques I got was to find a better way to layout the right side of the website. The albums are not displayed in a way where you can clearly see each of the signatures. I will take a new photo (and include all 8 members) as well as find a new way to lay them out. I am also considering finding a way to gray out or blur the rest of the albums aside from the one being highlighted so each of albums will be showcased properly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Expert Feedback: </strong>I will share my ideas with one of my cousin's friends, who is a UI/UX designer. Additionally, I will reach out to the undergraduate Design tutor or another design professor.</p>
