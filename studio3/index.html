                        <li>
                            The total of the roll is added to the current player's score, unless either die comes up as
                            a "pig". If this happens, this player's turn is over, and it is the other player’s turn.

                        <li>
                            If a player rolls two "pigs", that player's current score gets zeroed out, and
                            they have to start over, accumulating points from zero.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After each roll, the current player can either roll again, (assuming a "pig" was not rolled)
                            or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player.
                        </li>
                        <li>The first player to get 30 points or higher wins.</li>
