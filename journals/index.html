                    <p>Essentially, the best way to make well designed forms is to create it in digestable chunks without overloading the user with information. Making it vertical and also starting with basic questions and progressing into more difficult ones will help the users go through the form more smoothly. </p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, it is essential to be clear about what information you want from the user. This can be done by marking required fields or cleaerly stating the desired format for the input. things such as clear typography as well as proper sizing for elements is also extremely important.</p>
                    
                    <p>One of the worst forms I have encountered was an application for an old award in highschool. There were many fields present on one page and sections asking for files without specifying where to put such documents. Unfortunately, I no longer have the link to the application as I am no longer apart of that organization.
