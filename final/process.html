                    <p>For this project, I wanted to add features to improve on it's functionality. However the coding ideas are relatively simple as they just add additional overlays and switch images out, therefore I didn't want to do a flowchart. I wanted to create a composition showing another set of photocards that I collect, while also telling the users more about the people involved with my collection. When first showing other people my projects, I noticed aside from just hovering, many attempted to click on the polaroids. I am currently unsure of any other visual changes that I would make to the project at this point and I am also debating adding audio.</p>
